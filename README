ZooKeeper Config Parser & Validator
-----------------------------------

Target: ZooKeeper 3.3.x

Author: Andrei Savu -- http://www.andreisavu.ro/  

Development status: Experimental

A Python class for Parsing and Validating ZooKeeper config files.

Usage
-----

This class can be used in two ways:

* by importing it in your scripts

    from zoocfg import ZooCfg, Rules

    cfg = ZooCfg.from_file('zoo.cfg')
    cfg = ZooCfg(file_content)

    check = Rules.check_all(cfg)
    if check.has_errors():
        # we've got errors in the configuration file

    if check.has_warnings():
        # some things are strange

* or by using the command-line tool

    ./zoocfg.py -f zoo.cfg -w
    -- will output errors and warnings found while checking the rules

Typical output
--------------


$ ./zoocfg.py -f samples/standalone-zoo.cfg -w
Warnings:
* You should run at least 3 ZooKeeper servers.

* The `dataLogDir` should not use the same partition as `dataDir` in order to avoid competition between logging and snapshots. Having a dedicated log device has a large impact on throughput and stable latencies.


$ ./zoocfg.py -f samples/replicated-zoo.cfg -w
Warnings:
* The `dataLogDir` should not use the same partition as `dataDir` in order to avoid competition between logging and snapshots. Having a dedicated log device has a large impact on throughput and stable latencies.

* `dataDir` contains a relative path. This could be a problem if ZooKeeper is running as daemon.

* Your ensemble contains more than 3 servers. It's recommended to set `leaderServers` to `no`. This willallow the leader to focus only on coordination.

* no support for hierarhical groups and weights
* no support for observers
